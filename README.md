This small repository is the intro to recursion and email extraction.
Recursion functions (or methods) call themselves, either directly or indirectly through other functions 
(methods). Function calls a fresh copy of itself to work on the smaller problem - this is referred to a recursive
call and this is also call recursion step. This concept of seperating the problem into to smaller portions
is a form of divide-and-conquer approach. 
Other small programs shows usage of extract_emails module, which works for some web pages very well.
